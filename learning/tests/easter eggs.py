import this # Prints the zen of python in console: "The Zen of Python" is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in the Python language. It was written by Tim Peters, a long-time contributor to the Python community, and is included in the Python interpreter as an Easter egg. The Zen of Python consists of 19 aphorisms that provide a philosophical framework for Python programmers to follow, such as "Simple is better than complex" and "Readability counts". It encourages developers to write clean, simple, and easy-to-understand code, and has become a popular guide for writing Python code that is both efficient and elegant.

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# NEVER USE KEYWORDS FOR DEFINING THINGS AS IT WILL GO OVER THEM AND RAISE ERROR. (ex. dict = and dict())
